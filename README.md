* The goal is to have your cards total closer to **21** than the dealerâ€™s without going over.
* Number cards are worth their face value.
* Face cards (**J, Q, K**) are worth **10**.
* Aces (**A**) can be worth **1** or **11**, whichever benefits the hand.
* You can:

  * **Hit**: Take another card.
  * **Stand**: Keep your current total.
* If your hand exceeds **21**, you bust and lose.
